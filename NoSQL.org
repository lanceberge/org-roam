#+title: NoSQL

Either key-value store, document store, or graph db

Joins are usually done in application code

NoSQL Typically denormalizes data, lacks true ACID, and favors eventual consistency

* Key-Value Store

- Simple O(1) reads & writes and is the basis for document stores and sometimes graph [[id:8C8AADB8-324A-4DF4-9A15-E7AED2E08711][Database]]s

* Document Store

- Has JSON or binary underlying a document

DynamoDB for example supports key-value and document

* Wide Column Store

Enables super columns that have multiple columns in themselves

Ex: Companies and address,website super-columns

| Companies |               |           |     |
| Address   |               | Website   |     |
| City      | San Francisco | Subdomain | WWW |

* Graph Database

- Good for complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships

* SQL vs. NoSQL

SQL:

 - Structured, strict, relational data
 - Complex joins
 - Fast index lookups
 - Established communities and tooling
 - Good support for many-to-many and many-to-one relations
   - Just have everything in tables and the query optimizer will decide which indexes to use
       Rather than following complicated paths with a document DB
   - Queries run by the database will likely be more efficient than emulating joins with application code


NoSQL:

 - Flexible schema
 - Can provide better locality
 - Good for hot tables
 - Can be better for writes

** Best Use Cases of NoSQL

   - A tree like structure where the whole tree is loaded as once (use a document model)

** Use Cases of Relational

   - many-to-many relationships

* Object-Relational Mismatch

  OOP languages mean that we need to translate data to relational models,
  whereas NoSQL supports it by default

  JSON provides better locality than multi-table schema
    (ex. a table for positions, industries, regions, education) for a LinkedIn profile

  Using ids instead of plain text strings:
    You can give users a dropdown of options to avoid ambiguity and enable ease of updating
    Using ids is useful if you ever update the info

** Normalization

   - Sometimes, normalizing data leads to many-to-one relationships (many people living in one area)

This leads to multiple queries to emulate a join
