Persistent bidirectional communication between server-client or client-client

- You need to establish an HTTP handshake then negotiate the HTTP upgrade.
  - This gets tricky if you have proxies, load balancers, because each will need to negotiate the upgrade

* Vs. SSE

  Server-side-events are unidirectional, but persistent messages from server-client
