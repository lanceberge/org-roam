- Lets you keep data geographically close to users
- Allow for failover
- Horizontally scale read queries

* Leader-Follower (Master-Slave)

- One Replica is the Leader - all writes go through the leader
  - This sends each write to the followers

** Synchronous vs Asynchronous

- Synchronous: The leader waits for the follower's response that it received the data

  This is disadvantageous if the follower crashes, the leader has to block all writes until the ok is received
  But it's advantageous that the followers are guaranteed to be up to date with the leader

Semi-Synchronous: One of the followers will be synchronous, and the others will be async

 - If the synchronous follower gets slow, one of the async followers will be made synchronous.
 - Thus, an up-to-date copy of the data will be available on at least two nodes

*** Fully Asynchronous

- If the leader fails, any writes that haven't yet gone to followers will be lost
  - But the advantage is that it'll be much faster

** Setting up New Followers

- Take consistent snapshots of the leader's [[id:8C8AADB8-324A-4DF4-9A15-E7AED2E08711][Database]]
- Copy the snapshot to the new follower
- The follower connects to the leader and requests new data changes ([[id:40493a16-91dd-4a94-bb8a-59c358284beb][PostgreSQL]] log sequence number)

** Handling Node Outages

Follower Failure

- The follower that crashes will know it's last transaction before the fault, thus will connect to the leader and take new writes

Leader Failure - Failover

- Need to: Promote a follower, configure clients to send their writes to the new leader, inform followers of the new leader

1. Identify that the leader failed - if it doesn't respond for 30s
2. Choose a new leader - the most up to date replica

*** Failover

- Async - usually discard writes

* Replication Log Strategies

Statement-Based - store the leader's write statements (SQL queries)
  - This breaks down if nondeterministic functions such as NOW() or RAND() are used
  - Auto-incrementing columns thta get out of date
  - Triggers and stored procedures can have side effects and lead to nondeterministic behavior

  The leader can replace nondeterministic function calls with a fixed return value when the
    statement is logged
