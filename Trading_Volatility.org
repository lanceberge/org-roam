Term Structure - Longer-dated has higher IV
Skew - Far OTM and ITM options have higher IV
Being short skew - betting that the differential between OTM options at ATM options will decrease

   - dVega / dIV

* Vanna

  - dDelta / dIV

* Variance vs Vol Swaps

  - Variance swaps have more exposure to skew (far OTM options)

* Vol Overpricing

  Due to:
  - Demand for hedges
  - People buying OTM lottery tickets
  - Bids from structured products e.g. variable annuities

* Volatility

  - Vol is standard deviation of returns. So if a stock is always going up with a constant slope,
    it's vol is still 0
  - Vol of vol is underpriced
  - Futures on vol indices are short vol of vol
  - Volatility futures are generally overpriced because realized < IV

* VIX

  - Pricing is based on 1/S^2 weighted (S is strike price) therefore it's exposed to the price of deep OTM puts
