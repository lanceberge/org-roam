[[id:78573C75-A04A-450F-98B8-A650B7AC286A][Transfer Protocols]]

- Kafka uses protocol buffers over TCP
- Does sequential disk IO wherever possible

* Kafka vs. [[id:3DAEAED2-F8E1-41DD-BC46-585F940A4467][AWS]] SQS

  - SQS uses HTTPS

* Brokers

  - Cluster - multiple brokers
  - Broker - individual servers
  - Partitions - a sequence of messages that's appended to. These are split up by key. Basically the partitions are like individual queues
    - Each partition has a leader to handle writes
  - Messages are written to a WAL on disk
  - Data is replicated across brokers
  - Topics - a grouping of messages. Topics can be split across brokers
  - You can assign keys to messages to specify which partition they get appended to

* Consumer Groups

  - You can have multiple consumers, but each event is guaranteed to be processed by only one consumer
