* ELI5

  - Probabilistic - says an element is probably in a set
    - has some false positives but no false negatives
    - can 100% verify that a key isn't in a set
  - It doesn't retrieve the elements, it just says if they're in the set

* How it Works

  - Uses a massive bit array
  - Uses multiple hash functions - ex. 3
  - Each value added gets hashed to a value in the bit array 3 times, we update the hashed values in the bit array to 1
  - On lookups, if all three hash functions map to 1, we know that the value is probably in the set
    - It's only a probably true because there could be collisions for all three values
    - But if we encounter any 0, we know that it isn't added
