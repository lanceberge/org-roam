* 1. Basics

  - Main Memory: a temporary storage device that holds the data of a program. It's a collection of DRAM chips

** CPUs

   - Composed or Arithmetic Logic Units and registers
   - CPUs run processes concurrently by saving and restoring context via /context switching/
     - This is managed by the system kernel which always resides in memory

** Virtual Memory

   - Main memory is segmented such that independent processes have their own isolated memory

** Kernel

   - Manages processes
   - Allocates memory
   - Performs sys calls

* 2. Information Storage
** Hex

   A - 1010
   C - 1100
   F - 1111

** Binary

   For powers of 2, i.e. x = 2^n, the binary of x is just 1 followed by n zeros
