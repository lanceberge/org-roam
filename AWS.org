* Fundamentals

Client-server model

- We make requests to the server, which returns data

** Cloud Computing

- Provide various services that are abstractions of compute and memory needs

** Deployment Models

- Cloud-Based - Everything is run in the cloud
- On-Premises - Deployed onsite using virtualization
- Hybrid - Connect cloud-based resources to physical infrastructure

* EC2

- EC2 instances are virtual machines that can be provisioned
- Multitenacy - sharing of resources between VMs
- Vertical scaling - increasing the amount of compute resources

** Instance Types

- General purpose - balanced resources
- Compute optimized - HPC
  - Good for batch processing (running computations on small amounts of data)
- Memory optimized - fast performance for large datasets (more efficient for reads)
- Accelerated computing - Floating point computations, graphics
- Storage optimized - high performance for locally stored data (mroe efficient for sequential reads and writes)

** Costs

- On-Demand - pay for exactly what use
- Savings plan - Commit to a duration and get a potentially cheaper plan
- Reserved - Gives a big discount for extremely consistent usage
  - 1 and 3 year contracts
- Spot instances - Request spare compute capacity, but AWS can reclaim the usage whenever they want
- Dedicated hosts - Intense capacity fully dedicated to the user

** Scaling & Load-Balancing

- Auto-Scaling - set a minimum, desired, and maximum amount of EC2 resources to scale to
- Load-Balancing - The service that directs traffic between auto-scaling group
  - This is meant to ensure that EC2 instances don't have to do all of the work by themselves

** Messaging and Queueing

- SQS - lets you send messages into a queue - enables different software components to communicate
  - This enables a loosely-coupled architecture
- SNS - uses a publish/subscribe model - people subscribe to a topic and messages are sent to those subscribers
- Monolithic vs microservices - monolithic - everything is tightly coupled. Microservices - loosely coupled services that prevent a single point of failure

** Serverless Computing

- EC2 - if you want full access to the underlying OS
- Lambda - upload your code, create a trigger for it. The management of the underlying instances are configured and provisioned for you
  - Pay only for the compute power you use
- ECS - Allows us to provide compute power to containers. Docker provides system-level virtualization through containers (a way to package your application and its dependencies)
- AWS Fargate - Serverless computing for containers
- EKS - run Kubernetes on AWS

*** Pros vs. Cons

    - Serveress auto-scales
      - Only pay for what you use
      - Serverless can lead to cold starts
    - Managed can be more cost-effective for consistent workloads

* AWS Global Architecture

- AWS Regions - there are AWS regions in the busiest locations across the world
- Data doesn't flow between regions unless the user allows it
- Choose regions closest to where your users are
- Availability Zones - a single group of data centers
- CDN - Network that delivers content to users based on their geographical location

** Edge Locations

- AWS CloudFront - used to deliver data to customers across the world using edge locations
- Edge locations - separate from regions. Run Route 53 - a DNS service
  - These are sites that store cached copies of your data
- AWS Outposts - let you install a mini region in your server

** Interacting with AWS

- Through SDKs or CLI

** Deployment

- EBS
- Cloudformation - lets you declare your AWS resources using JSON

* Networking

- VPC                - whitelist or blacklist certain IP addresses
- Subnets            - chunks of IP addresses that allow you to group resources together
  - Basically a group of EC2 instances. Some will be privately accessible, some publicly
- VPN                - the bodyguard
- AWS Direct Connect - lets you establish a private connection from your data center to AWS
  - This is the secret path
- Default security group - doesn't allow any traffic into the EC2 instance
- Packets - messages from the internet
- Network ACL - checks if each packet can get through (stateless)
- Security group - has a state (memory) of what can come through
  - Deny by default

** DNS and Route 53

- Routes URLs to the underlying website
- DNS resolution - translate domain name to IP address

* Databases

- Block storage - lets you overwrite only the components that are changed when you update a file
- EBS lets us create virtual hard drives that we can attach to our EC2 instances
  - data is in the same AZ

** S3

- Data is stored in buckets
- S3 standard IA - rapid access but less frequent

** EFS

- lets you have multiple instances accessing the data - data is stored across multiple Availability zones

** DynamoDB

- Serverless, store data in items and attributes
- Data is across multiple AZs

** Redshift

- Data warehousing - lets you collect data from multiple sources

* Security
** User Permissions

- IAM - identity access management
  - Lets you control the access permissions of users
  - Roles - An identity you can switch to for temporary permissions
  - Groups - groups of users with the same permissions
- AWS Organizations - central location to manage AWS accounts (i.e. if you have various accounts)
  - Organizational Units (OUs) - when you apply a policy to an OU, all of the accounts inherit it
- AWS Artifact - provide access to compliance and security reports

** AWS Shield Advanced

- fight sloworis and DDOS attacks

** Security Services

- Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) - lets you perform encryption operations
- WAF - web application framework, lets you monitor network requests
- Inspector - automated security assessments
- GuardDuty - threat detection

* Monitoring and Analytics

- Cloudwatch - set alarms based on triggers
- CloudTrail - log every request (API call) to AWS
- AWS Trusted Advisor - Check the security, performance, cost of your system, fault tolerance, and provide advice

* Billing

- Dashboard - show all of your billing info
- Consolidated billing - get a singular bill if you have multiple AWS accounts for the same company
- Budget - you can set a budget and get an alert if you're close to the threshold
- Cost Explorer - visualize spending
- Support plans - business gives you Trusted avdisor
- AWS Marketplace - independently created AWS services

* Migration and Innovation

* Organizations, IAM

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aws iam create-user --user-name your-username

# Attach a policy to the user (start with minimal permissions)
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name your-username --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess

# Create a role (run this in each member account)
aws iam create-role --role-name CrossAccountAccess --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
  #+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

Configure each account with the AWS CLI

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
aws configure --profile master-account
aws configure --profile project1
aws configure --profile project2
#+END_SRC

For the member account profiles, use the ARN of the cross-account role instead of access keys:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
[profile project1]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::PROJECT1_ACCOUNT_ID:role/CrossAccountAccess
source_profile = master-account
#+END_SRC

* Fargate

  - Create task definition
  - Create a cluster
  - Create a service - runs the task definition in the cluster
    - Create a custom security group with the port (3000) for [[id:D846457A-1522-4ADA-999B-35095AA0AB4A][SvelteKit]]
      - Make it available to all: 0.0.0.0/0,::/0
