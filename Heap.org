- The children are always larger than the parents
- Store values in an array
  - root at idx 0, left node at 1, right child at 2, etc.

* Removal

  - Remove the root. Swap the last leaf to the root. Bubble it down - swap with the smallest leaf until it's larger than it's leaves

* Adding

- Add to the lowest possible leaf then bubble up - swapping until it's <= the parent
