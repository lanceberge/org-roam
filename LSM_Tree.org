  - Optimized for writes
  - [[id:237AAE85-C261-4743-861D-2B9A2908D1FB][B-Trees]] are optimized for writes
  - Writes are saved in-memory in a Memtable - a balanced binary tree
  - As memory fills up, we flush them to disk in a SSTable
  - We repeatedly run compaction algs in the background to clear up deleted tombstones and merge SSTables
