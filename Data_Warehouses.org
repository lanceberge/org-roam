#+title: Data Warehouses

- Separate database from OLTP systems - meant for analytics
- ETL pipeline from OLTP systems to data warehouse

* Implementation

  - There's a middle fact table that links to other tables. The fact table represents each transaction

** Columnar Storage

   - OLAP queries are based on only a few columns at a time and are frequently range-based
   - For OLAP, we use columnar storage instead of row-oriented storage that OLTP uses. An entry becomes a column instead of a row
     - Thus the database because wide and short instead of tall and skinny

** Column-Compression

   - Column layouts are good for column compression because we will have fewer distinct values in columns
   - We will have slower writes to the data warehouse but faster range-based and WHERE queries

** Materialized View

   - since we don't care as much about write speed and we do care about key analytics, we can also
     maintain things like averages that update with each write
