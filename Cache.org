[[id:5A1C593C-55D4-4760-B85A-A7112FB017A9][Distributed Systems]]

- Good for data that's read frequently but modified infrequently
- It's a good practice to add an expiration policy for when to remove data from the cache
- LRU - evict the least-recently-used data
- [[id:8C8AADB8-324A-4DF4-9A15-E7AED2E08711][Database]]s frequently have some sort of caching. You can tweak this for more specific use cases

Caching Queries

 - This approach is tough with complex queries
 - If one piece of data changes, you need to find and modify all queries that might include the cached data

 Caching Objects

  - Cache web pages, user sessions
  - Cache objects with cache.set(key, json.dumps(object))

** Write-Through

- The cache always sits between the db and the client - for reads and writes
- Writes go to the cache, the cache writes to db

Disadvantages

 - The db could lose data if the cache goes down prior to writes
