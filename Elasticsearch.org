#+title: Elasticsearch
#+filetags: Programming

- Fuzzy matching
- Good at searching for text in a document db or unstructured data
- Is essentially a highly-indexed database
- Ranks results based on how close they are to the query
- Filtering data
- Good for unstructured data
- Create reverse- indexes on fields in the DB to search for them

* Elasticsearch stores documents, indexes, mappings, and fields

  - Documents are docs, JSON objects, etc.
  - Indexes - Like a database table. It's a collection of searchable documents
  - Mapping - which fields need to be searched for efficiently. You can also specify the data types here for range queries, etc.
  - Elasticsearch maps terms (words, numbers) to document IDs

* Reverse Indexes

  - Features that we want to quickly search for - e.g. Tweets, usernames
  - You can use something like CDC - change data capture which can update [[id:a170dd65-f2d2-43aa-aff0-322f1edc1fc4][Elasticsearch]] whenever content in the db changes

* Geospatial indexes
